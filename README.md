# AUAV Drone Show

Welcome to the AUAV Drone Show Repository. This repository is a comprehensive collection of files and code snippets that are potentially useful for anyone interested in drone performances and swarm flying techniques. Our repository is designed to cater to a wide range of applications, from hobbyists to professional drone show programmers.

## Repository Contents
**handTracking**
**Description:** **handTracking.py** is a sophisticated script that integrates hand gesture recognition with drone control. This code enables a drone to recognize and respond to hand gestures, facilitating intuitive control of drone movements. Additionally, it includes a follow-me feature, allowing the drone to track and follow the movements of the hand.

**sinWaveSampleCode**
**Description:** **sinWaveSampleCode.py** is designed to make drones fly following a sinusoidal trajectory. This script is particularly useful for creating mesmerizing aerial shows where drones move in smooth, wave-like patterns, emulating the mathematical elegance of a sine wave.

**swarmSampleCode**
**Description:** **swarmSampleCode.py** includes the foundational code for drone swarming. It covers the essentials of drone-to-drone communication and coordination, laying the groundwork for more complex swarm behaviors. This code is vital for anyone looking to explore the dynamics of drone swarms.

## Getting Started
To get started with these scripts, clone this repository to your local machine. Each script comes with detailed comments explaining its functionality and how to use it. Ensure you have the necessary hardware and software environment set up for running these scripts, as detailed in the individual script documentation.

## Contribution
Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have improvements or additional scripts that can enhance drone performances or swarm operations, please feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgments
A special thanks to all contributors and supporters of the AUAV Drone Performance and Swarm Repository. Your contributions and feedback are immensely valuable to the growth and improvement of this project.
